# Profitability Calculations

In this section, we will calculate the profitability ratio of two products. The hourly profit ratio is obtained by dividing the product price by the hourly profit.

**Profitability Ratio** = Product Price / Hourly Profit

## Product 1

- **Product Price:** 12,109,555 TL
- **Hourly Profit:** 14,640 TL/hour

**Profitability Ratio**: 12,109,555 / 14,640 ≈ 827.22 hours

## Product 2

- **Product Price:** 6,969,348 TL
- **Hourly Profit:** 5,060 TL/hour

**Profitability Ratio**: 6,969,348 / 5,060 ≈ 1377.25 hours

According to this calculation, **the first product is more profitable** because it has a lower profitability ratio.
